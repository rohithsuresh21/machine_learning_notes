LINEAR REGRESSION

📘 Linear Regression: The Theory
1. What is it?
Linear Regression is a Supervised Learning algorithm used to predict a continuous numerical value. It assumes there is a direct, straight-line relationship between your input (Independent Variable) and your output (Dependent Variable).

2. The Mathematical Equation
At its heart, Linear Regression is just a simple geometry equation:  y=mx+c
y (Target): The value you want to predict (e.g., Final Score).
x (Feature): The data you already have (e.g., Current Overs).
m (Coefficient/Slope): This represents the weight. It tells the model how much y changes for every 1 unit of x. (e.g., How many runs are usually scored per over).
c (Intercept): The starting point. The value of y when x is zero.

3. How does the model "Learn"?
The model uses a method called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

It draws a random line through your data points.
It calculates the Residuals (the distance/error between the actual data point and the line).
It squares those errors and adds them up (Sum of Squared Errors).
It keeps tilting and moving the line until that total error is the smallest possible.
