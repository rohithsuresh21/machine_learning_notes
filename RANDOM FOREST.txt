RANDOM FOREST

1. What is a Random Forest?
It is an Ensemble method. "Ensemble" just means a group. It creates many Decision Trees (a "Forest") and combines their outputs.

For Classification: Every tree "votes" for a category (Win or Loss). The category with the most votes wins.

For Regression: Every tree predicts a number. The final answer is the average of all those numbers.

2. Why is it better than a single Decision Tree?
Reduces Overfitting: A single tree might memorize specific weird rows in your data (like that one time a team won from an impossible situation). A Random Forest ignores those "flukes" because the other 99 trees won't agree with it.

Handles Messy Data: It’s very good at dealing with missing values or "outliers" (weird data points).

Stability: Small changes in your data won't change the final prediction much.

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

How to make the Random Forest "Smarter" (Hyperparameters)

To truly master Random Forests, you need to know which "knobs" to turn. These are called Hyperparameters. In your code, you can change these inside the RandomForestClassifier() brackets:

1.n_estimators: (You used 100).

Low (10): Fast, but might make mistakes (too few "voters").

High (500): Very stable, but takes more memory and time.

2.max_depth: (How tall the trees grow).

None (Default): Trees grow until they perfectly memorize every row. This can lead to Overfitting.

Small (3 or 5): Forces trees to find "General Rules" rather than memorizing names/details.

3.max_features: (The "Randomness" knob).

It decides how many features each tree can see at each split. Usually, it's set to 'sqrt'.
